        My interest in web and coding did not come until the beginning of 2020, I thought of it as something unachievable. I took my first web design class and was very excited but very intimidated. Web is something I believed to be way outside of my wheel house. I was wrong. Once I began coding in April 2020, I quickly realized I loved it. I got through the rough patches of understanding the languages and I feel as if I have caught my stride. I’m learning every day, teaching myself stuff beyond the scope of the class room. I even decided to add another major, Interactive Digital Media, to further my knowledge. Now I have my first freelance website published, built my own portfolio from the ground up and I have done multiple other side projects to hone my skill set.

As a smaller hydraulics and mechanics company they wanted something that represents their company and what they stand for, hard and quality work. They wanted the information to be easily delivered and to the point. At the moment I am currently managing their domain and contumely updating their website as needed. It was and continues to be a pleasure to work Schwab Brother Hydraulics company. </p>

       Summary
     </h2>
     <p class="project-summary summary-text">During my Web 3 class we presented with our final project, it was a group project. This endeavor was intimidating being in a state of isolation due to the Corona Virus Pandemic. We were given the prompt of designing and coding a website that was fully functional. Our groups task was to create a website that encourage and brought light to design in politics and emphasize the necessity of it. I was paired with 3 of students. We used a multitude of tools to succeed in a fully remote and digital setting. We regularly used Zoom and Microsoft Teams to communicate. To distribute and manage content we used Abstract for out Sketch Files, along with Github once we began our indevoured into coding. We divided the task properly and were able finish this in under 3 weeks. This was and awesome experience that allowed me to get comfortable with a remote work environment. My personal responsibilities were the “IMPACT” page, progress bar and a joint effort on the “Home” page.

      These two web sites are personal experimentation with motion and page layout. I took these as a chance to challenge my speed and skill set at the time. The first one, “Scotland #1”, was completed in roughly 2 weeks. The second one, “Scotland #2”, was complete in a week. These projects took place about a month a part. It was very interesting and uplifting to see my ability grow in a tangible way.
