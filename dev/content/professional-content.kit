                Zensibly Green is a veteran owned business that aims to help people make more Eco-friendly lifestyle choices that reduce consumer waste and plastic pollution in the environment. They approached me to establish a brand design before their website launch. We worked together on incorporating all the aspects that they believed to define their company; rustic, dependable and forward thinking. I began the design with their request in mind; a tree on top of a mountain. After multiple rounds of section and logo evolution we came to the design we have now. We achieved something that Zensibly Green and I are very proud of.
